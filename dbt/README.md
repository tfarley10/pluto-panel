# NYC Land Use Dataset

## Overview

While snapshots of Land Use (Zoning) regulations data for NYC  are [readily available](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/about/), viewing changes in regulation over time are harder to come by. I'm using NYC DCP's Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) archived dataset's and aggregating them from 2002 to 2020.

### Questions of Interest

- On net, did the Bloomberg administration up-zone or down-zone NYC? Where are the relative differences?

#### Drilling down with American Community Survey data

- Were neighborhoods with higher car ownership more likely to down-zone than those with lower car ownership?
