          For each document there is one and only one master record. 
          As such the master record contains attributes for a document that can appear only once for a document like the document type,date and recorded date and time. 
          The first field of the master record is the 16 character ACRIS document id which uniquely identifies a document in ACRIS. 
          This document id is included in each subsequent record type and can be used to link these records back to the master record. 
          This document id can also be used to look up the document in ACRIS Document Search.
