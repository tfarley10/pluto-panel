# NYC Housing Data

## Overview  

Urban and suburban housing shortages have had vital topic in national and local politics. Understanding how land-use regulations affect these shortages has mostly been done by anectdote and silo'd data sources. This project aims to centralize this data for New York City to make new analyses possible.
